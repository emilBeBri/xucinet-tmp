All deprecated tests have been ported to new functional tests in tests/functional/test_*.py.

All of these tests can be removed at any time, and will be removed in a later version when all the old function tests in tests/old_functional_tests/test_*.py have been ported.

If at any time these tests get in the way, remove them.
